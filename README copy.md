## Quick primer

[MFE with Nx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dotA6ZSmNL4)

## Add a new remote mfe

Run below command to add a new remote
```
nx g @nx/react:remote apps/<new_remote_app> --host="apps/dashboard"
```

## Start application

Add any remotes that you want to be started alongside `dashboard` host
```
pnpm start --devRemotes="dashboard"
```

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Learn about Nx

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.
